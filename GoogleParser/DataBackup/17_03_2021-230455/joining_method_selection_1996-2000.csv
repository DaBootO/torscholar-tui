Method for joining DNA fragments using positive selection|AN Gubin - BioTechniques, 1996 - Future Science|https://scholar.google.com/https://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.2144/96213bm15|1996|0|4|None|None|None|https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15675175291418363553&hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&as_ylo=1996&as_yhi=2000|None|DNA into plasmids. To subclone an additional fragment into the plasmid, one must use a different approach to select for the desired clone (minipreps, restriction digest, polymerase chain reaction, etc.). Here I describe a simple method for joining two fragments of DNA, with …
